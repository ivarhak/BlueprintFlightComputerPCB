Files for my flight computer project as a part of the Hack Club foundation's Blueprint program 2025.
Board has an STM chip, 2 BMP351 barometers, 1 ICM-42688-P IMU, a microSD slot, battery charging capabilities, and servo pins.
Feel free to use and modify.

The main idea with the board is to have a solid platform on which there are high-quality sensors to put on any rocketry project. The two barometers help eliminate noise, and the ICM is of high quality. The two servo pin headers let the user connect this flight computer to any PWM project, like airbrakes or canard systems. 

Special thanks to @Notaroomba, Hack Club, and @rasmushauschild for creating the guides and tools necessary to make this awesome PCB.
3d model can be found in the hardware folder, was so big I had to compress it.
